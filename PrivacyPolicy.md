# Privacy Policy

The use of FarmBot ("Bot") in a server requires the collection of some specific user data ("Data"). The Data collected includes, but is not limited to Discord user ID values. Use of the Bot is considered an agreement to the terms of this Policy. 

## Access to Data

Access to Data is only permitted to Bot's developers, and only in the scope required for the development, testing, and implementation of features for Bot. Data is not sold, provided to, or shared with any third party, except where required by law or a Terms of Service agreement. You can view the data upon request from `@Farmer#0069`.

## Storage of Data

Data is stored in a Postgreql database. The database is secured to prevent external access, however no guarantee is provided and the Bot owners assume no liability for the unintentional or malicious breach of Data. In the event of an unauthorised Data access, users will be notified through the Discord client application.

## Message Content

The only instance that FarmBot will look at a users message content, is if a user is using the Global Chat channels. FarmBot does not store this content, but forwards it to all servers that have opted into this service. If you chose to not have your message content looked at by FarmBot, then you can avoid using these channels.

## User Rights

At any time, you have the right to request to view the Data pertaining to your Discord account. You may submit a request through [The Farm](https://discord.gg/zQHyJKrA7K). You have the right to request the removal of your data at any point.

## Underage Users

The use of the Bot is not permitted for minors under the age of 13, or under the age of legal consent for their country. This is in compliance with the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms). No information will be knowingly stored from an underage user. If it is found out that a user is underage we will take all necessary action to delete the stored data.

## Questions

If you have any questions or are concerned about what data might be being stored from your account contact `@Farmer#0069`. For more information check the [Discord Terms Of Service](https://discord.com/terms).
